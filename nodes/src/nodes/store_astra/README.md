# store_astra

A RocketRide vector store for Astra DB that stores embedded document chunks and retrieves matching content in a pipeline or through an agent tool.

## About Astra DB

Astra DB is a database service with a Data API for application access. This node uses that API to create and query a collection whose vector and lexical search features are enabled. It is a storage and retrieval backend: it does not create embeddings or host a local database.

## What it does

The node writes embedded documents from the `documents` lane to an Astra collection and searches that collection for incoming questions. Semantic questions use the question embedding as the collection's vector sort; keyword questions use Astra's lexical sort. It can also bind `search`, `upsert`, and `delete` to an agent.

Choose it when the data must live behind an Astra Data API endpoint and you want Astra to provide both vector and lexical retrieval. Pick a sibling store instead when your existing collection lives in that sibling's database; this node creates and manages an Astra collection rather than adapting another store's protocol.

The collection is created only on the first write. Its vector dimension comes from those first incoming embeddings, its configured similarity is applied at creation, and lexical search is enabled with Astra's `standard` analyzer. A question or read against a collection that has not been created simply returns no documents.

## Lanes

| Lane in | Lane out | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `documents` | — | Store pre-embedded document chunks. |
| `questions` | `documents` | Emit matching documents. |
| `questions` | `answers` | Emit matching documents as answers. |
| `questions` | `questions` | Enrich the question with matching documents. |

## As a tool

The configured tool server name is the namespace for the functions below; it defaults to `astra`.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `search` | Search the collection for matching documents. |
| `upsert` | Add or update documents in the collection. |
| `delete` | Remove documents by object ID. |

`search` and an `upsert` without a supplied embedding use the node's bound embedding provider. These calls are on the agent tool channel, not the document lanes. Give each Astra node a distinct tool server name when an agent can reach more than one of them.

`search` accepts an optional `filter` object honoring only `objectId`, `nodeId` and `parent`; any other key is rejected. `upsert` accepts an optional `metadata` object storing `nodeId`, `parent` and `chunkId`, defaulting to `"vectordb_tool"`, `"/"` and `0` respectively.

## Profiles

Default: **Astra DB cloud server** (`cloud`).

| Profile | Endpoint | Collection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local test server | `http://localhost:8080` | `ROCKETRIDE` |
| Astra DB cloud server **(default)** | Set an API endpoint | `ROCKETRIDE` |

## Configuration

Choose the profile, then provide the endpoint, token, collection, similarity, and retrieval score for the Astra database. The profile supplies the initial connection values; most deployments only need to replace the cloud endpoint and token. Feed an embedding node before this store: an arriving document without an embedding raises an error instead of being stored.

### Endpoint, token, and collection

Set **API Endpoint** to the Astra Data API endpoint and **Application Token** to the token used by `DataAPIClient`. The local profile deliberately starts with a local endpoint and test token, so replace both values when it is not your test server. A bad endpoint or token surfaces when the client uses the API; this node does not make a save-time connection probe.

Set a collection name before ingesting. It must start with a letter or number, and the remaining characters may only be letters, numbers, or underscores; startup rejects any other name. This matters before the first write because that write creates the collection—correct the name rather than expecting a later query to create it.

### Similarity and embedding dimension

The first successful ingest fixes the collection's vector dimension from the incoming embedding, and uses the selected similarity metric. `cosine` is the default; `euclidean` and `dot_product` are the only alternatives accepted by the implementation. Leave the default for ordinary normalized embedding vectors; change it only when the embedding model and the collection's intended metric agree. Reusing a collection with a different embedding length or an incompatible metric is a reason to create a separate collection rather than mix vectors.

### Retrieval score

The generated configuration supplies the requested retrieval score, while the store also has a floor: semantic hits below `0.20` are discarded before they reach any output lane. Scores are the Data API's normalised `$similarity`, between `0` and `1` for every metric. Raise the configured score when loosely related context is polluting answers; lower it when relevant content is absent, while remembering that values below the floor cannot restore those results. Keyword search does not carry this vector-similarity filter.

### Profile choice and first write

The cloud profile is the default and begins with empty endpoint and token values, which is the right starting point for an Astra deployment. The local profile is specifically a test-server preset: it uses `http://localhost:8080`, `test-token`, and the `ROCKETRIDE` collection. Select it only when that is the server you intend to reach; it is not a discovery mode for a cloud database.

The first write has two responsibilities: it creates the collection and supplies the vector dimension used for it. Send a small, representative embedded document after configuration rather than letting the first production batch establish an accidental dimension. Reads, deletes, and renders before that first creation are safe but return no stored content.

### Collection lifecycle controls

This store treats `chunkId` 0 as the beginning of a full object. If an ingest batch contains that chunk, the store schedules the object's existing chunks for deletion before inserting the new batch. Use a stable `objectId` across re-ingests to get replacement behavior; changing it creates another independently stored object.

Soft deletion is a separate lifecycle action. It leaves the chunks in Astra and changes `meta.isDeleted`, while a hard removal deletes the matching records. Choose soft deletion when a caller may need to inspect or restore the object; choose hard deletion when its data must no longer be stored.

### Tool Server Name

This is the namespace for agent functions, so the default exposes `astra.search`, `astra.upsert`, and `astra.delete`. Change it when multiple Astra nodes are connected to the same agent to prevent name collisions.

### Write switches

Allow document management from tool calls (`allow_writes`) is off by default.
Turn it on in the pipeline whose Tools source should be able to remove
documents from the collection, or add them with the `upsert` tool, through
tool calls, for example the pipeline the Vector Explorer manages. Even when it
is on, such a write is accepted only from a Tools source of the pipeline,
addressed to this node; calls from the pipeline's chat or ingest sources are
refused. Documents the pipeline's own lanes write are not affected by this
switch.

The switch does not apply to an agent in this pipeline: its `upsert` and
`delete` calls work as they always have.

## Authentication

Set **API Endpoint** to the Astra Data API endpoint and **Application Token** to the token passed to the Data API client. The local profile also has endpoint and token values, so replace them when connecting to a different local server. The node passes the configured token directly to the Data API client; it does not offer a second authentication mode.

## Notes

### Search behavior and filters

Keyword search uses Astra's native lexical sort and supports the requested offset and limit. Semantic search uses the question embedding, includes a similarity score, and uses the requested result limit. Both paths apply the standard document filters for node, parent, permissions, object, table, and chunk selection. By default they also require `meta.isDeleted` to be false, so marked-deleted content stays hidden unless a caller explicitly requests it.

The two search modes are selected by the incoming question rather than by a second connection setting. Use a semantic question when the vocabulary may differ from the stored text, and use keyword search when exact words, paging, or the lexical index are more important. A semantic query with no collection returns an empty set; a document with no embedding is rejected at ingestion rather than being converted to keyword-only content.

### Ingestion, replacement, and deletion

The node stores each chunk with a generated `_id`, the content, metadata, and its vector. It collects up to 500 chunks before inserting. If a chunk with `chunkId` 0 arrives, all existing chunks with the same `objectId` are deleted first, so a complete re-ingest replaces that object instead of duplicating it. A later batch of the same object (one without chunk 0) is added to it, and sent again (a retried batch) it replaces the chunks it holds instead of storing them twice. Near-zero vectors are omitted from the insert batch; the collection's zero-vector control record is stored with a unit vector instead, so it is kept (earlier releases dropped it, and the second write to a collection then failed).

The stored metadata is the declared document fields plus the control record's embedding model and vector size, without empty values; other metadata, such as file size and ingest time, is not stored on Astra. Rows written by earlier releases carry empty values and are still read. Earlier releases also left the embedding model and vector size out of the control record, so a collection they created cannot be searched or written by this node (its collection check needs both): re-create it. Counts use the Data API's `count_documents` with a ceiling of 1,000: the node's document count falls back to Astra's estimate above it, and a filtered count above it is reported as unknown. Reads by filter honour their offset (paging with a sort, as the Data API requires), and path listing returns live documents only, never the control record.

`markDeleted` and `markActive` update the `meta.isDeleted` flag for all chunks of the supplied object IDs, while `remove` permanently deletes those chunks. Rendering an object fetches its non-deleted chunks, sorts them by `chunkId` in the node, and joins their content because Astra does not guarantee the returned order.

That ordering detail matters when rendering a document whose chunks were written in parallel: do not rely on Astra's natural return order to reproduce the source text. The node makes the ordering decision itself, then calls the render callback with the combined text.

### Vector Explorer

The Vector Explorer app supports Astra DB as **experimental**: its explorer functions are tested against an in-memory stand-in for the Data API client, not against Astra. What the app sees on Astra:

- The document list pages through each document's chunk 0 in Astra's own storage order, following the Data API's page state (the app sorts what it has loaded by path). It shows no chunk count per document: the Data API cannot count per document without one request per row. A document whose chunk 0 is missing is not listed.
- The explorer never asks Astra to sort on a metadata field: the Data API answers such a request with at most 20 documents and sorts at most 10,000 rows in memory. Lists, chunk pages and the `objdir` paths are read unsorted, and a document's chunks are read by ranges of chunk ids and put in order on the node. File size and ingest time are not shown because Astra does not keep them.
- Chunk counts honour the active, deleted and all views (any other view is refused as invalid input); the collection's control record is never counted or listed. Collections written by earlier releases have no embedding model in their control record, so the model is shown as unknown there; the explorer still reads them, but searches and writes through this node need the collection re-created (see Ingestion above).
- Samples for the embedding map are taken in storage order, and the neighbour graph is computed on the node.
- Removing a document reports the number of chunks it removed.
- When Astra DB fails (unreachable, or a request it rejects), the explorer, the store's tools and the pipeline's writes report `Astra DB <operation> failed: <error class> (code N)`, for reads, writes, marks, renders and the collection checks alike. The client's own message, which can name the server, is not passed on. An error raised by the node's own code is reported as it is.

### Tool embedding dependency

Agent `search` needs an embedding for semantic retrieval, and agent `upsert` needs one to write a vector. Supplying an embedding in the tool call avoids that dependency; otherwise bind an embedding provider to the node. Do not assume the pipeline's document lane will supply it to a tool invocation—the two paths are separate.
